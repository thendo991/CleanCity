FEATURES NOT BEING TESTED

5.1 Driver Route Optimization Logic.

Due to not having access to the data of driver routes and logistics in the different towns.

5.2 Backend Infrastructure.

Because the testers wonâ€™t have access to the server.


TESTING PROCEDURES

6.1 Test Execution

For each core module that requires testing the testers will use predefined test cases with expected outcomes and will monitor if the test passes or fails, its particular test case. All the results of said test are then to be logged onto Jira and the task marked completed on the platform by the tester.

6.2 Order of Testing

The order of the testing will be determined by the order of tasks assigned to each tester on the Jira platform. Those tests will be assigned in a manner that ensures all members contribute to the testing of features without impeding each other in the process.

6.3 Pass Criteria

To pass the testing a feature must meet all the functional requirements set for it by testers and present no bugs or issues while doing that. Failure to meet those criteria will be counted as a failure.
